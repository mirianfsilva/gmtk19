## Threadchery

In this game what is alive must die for the destiny choosen one could rise.
Follow the line. But which one?
The threads of fate are all intertwined and full of meaning.
Allow yourself to let it go and move on.
Sometimes the sacrifice is really huge just for one to be in the ultimate place.
We aim just in one direction, to GLORY!

The "only one" theme is worked here in two main forms.
The first one, ONE controls ALL characters at the same time, i.e., the same instruction is given to each one on scene.
The second one is in the objective, before reaching the goal ALL but ONE must die.
This manifest itself in a puzzle platformer.
